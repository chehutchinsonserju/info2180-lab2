                    I beat the final boss of Season 4 today. "The rumors of my  
                    immortality are drastically...understated. Oh, Commander, you  
                    look so disappointed. So impotent. I feel for you, I really  
                    do. But let's be honest: you knew, in your heart. Fear not, 
                    the world will not forget you. The scars you've gouged 
                    into it spell out your name for all to see. I confess, 
                    I was happy to take credit for your "victories." But did 
                    you ever stop to wonder what that says about you? That so 
                    many bought what I was selling? They call me a monster and 
                    you a hero. The world expects Palawa Joko to dare to throw 
                    reality into chaos. But surely no mortal would be so monumentally 
                    stupid as to destroy a dragon, the life force of this world. 
                    Let alone two. And a god to boot? Perhaps they will finally 
                    thank me for luring you to me...So that I. May save the world. 
                    From you," - Palawa Joko.
                    <br><br><br>
                    The past of Palawa Ignacious Joko remains elusive regarding his 
                    life before becoming undead and during his early years as a lich. 
                    Joko himself has presented various contradictory arguments on his 
                    origins, claiming to be the last of the Primeval Kings as well as 
                    having lived so long ago that the fig leaf was in style. Mad King 
                    Thorn's Lunatic Courtiers, however, suggest offhand that Palawa 
                    Joko and King Thorn knew each other in life. According to the Private 
                    Property of P.I. Joko written by young "Iggy", however, Joko appears 
                    to have been the son of an Elonian diplomat (with the province of 
                    origin unknown) in the eighth century AE. In his youth, he accompanied 
                    his mother on her diplomatic tours and visited Kryta where, while 
                    suffering from boredom, he met with young Prince Oswald Thorn who 
                    was already showing signs of violence. Viewing the young Thorn ripping 
                    wings off of flies as amateurish for not utilizing torture to its 
                    fullest extent, Joko secretly taught the prince what creatures would 
                    survive torture and be of use afterwards, with the wording suggesting 
                    that Thorn should direct his sadism towards his servants instead. The 
                    young Thorn challenged Joko to a pun contest much to the latter's horror, 
                    and the pranks escalated into a clash between the two youths, the 
                    first battle to take place between the future lich king and Mad King.

                    "It's time I treat you with the respect you deserve. Speak face-to-face. 
                    It's finally time for us to talk. I understand why you want to silence me, 
                    but you must listen. For Tyria's sake. For thousands of years, I've watched 
                    this broken system consume entire civilizations. But it was not always this 
                    way. You, Aurene, and Iâ€”we can save this world. Preserve it. The air is 
                    thick with change. I feel it, even as I dream beneath the ice. 
                    Braham Eirsson: Jormag.Jormag: You fear me as you feared Kralkatorrik. 
                    That is natural. But ice fortifies. Ice protects.Jormag: All this war, all 
                    this pain... Aurene wants to end it. And I can help her. I want to help her. 
                    Jormag: Terrible things lurk just beyond the horizon. But you can bring 
                    eternal peace to our world.Jormag: In time, you'll realize you need me. 
                    And when you do, I'll be waiting."
                    <br><br><br>
                    "You do not fear death. You fear something far worse. You fear outliving 
                    the ones you swore to protect. You fear the day your children no longer 
                    feel the chill of the frost or the warmth of the flame. It is this fear 
                    that is your enemy, not I. The prison in which all races of Tyria suffer. 
                    But you need not fear me, champion, for I can set you free. Join me, and 
                    you shall have the strength to protect your people in the trials to come. 
                    Stand against me, and you stand alone," - Jormag.
